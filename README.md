# django-cms-tools

customizing django / django-cms. as reusable app.

to come / to think about

- better change view styles (visible fieldsets/inlines)
- hide "create" button in toolbar, with css
- convenience page_link tag:{% page_link "reverse_id_or_the_like" "css_class_name" "custom_link_text" %}
- maybe some defaults for plugins?
